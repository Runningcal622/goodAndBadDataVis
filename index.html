    <h2>A good Example of Data Visualization</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Functionality <br>
      This infographic is functional because it shows
      current data through the pie charts and then shows the
      trends through the line graphs to the right. It clearly demonstates the fact
      that the most people believe that the best is ahead of us.</li>
      <li>Beautiful <br>
      This infographic is generally pleasing because of the light blue and yellow they
      used to differentiate the different responses. However, it could be improved because the
      light blue is so often used. Maybe using different colors would make the globe stand out
      more from the rest of the background.</li>
      <li>Insightful <br>
      This infographic is insightful because of the way it uses past data to show the trend
      among patents. The United States has been the leader in recent past and while that remains
      true in this data; it is interesting to see Japan and China growing rapidly while the
      US declines. It is also helpful that the colors used for the lines in the graph match
      up with the colors used for the opinions. If a country is showing a negative correlation
      then it is colored with a "behind" response color.</li>
      <li> Truthful <br>
      This infographic is truthful because it does not seek to decieve the viewer of information
      important to the graphic. All graphs have only one y-axis. This info graphic is used to
      display data, not force you to an incorrect conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>Enlightening <br>
      This infographic is important because it seeks to inform on the topic of wether the
      collective optimism of progress will continue and lead to more improvements. The idea of
      self fufilling prophecy is vital becasue if people think that progress is in the past then
      it could occur soley because people think that it can't.

    <h2>A bad Example of Data Visualization</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Functionality <br>
      This infographic is not very functional because it tries to do to do
      too many things at once. And by doing this it does none of them well.
      There is not open space for the eyes to seperate content. It's very
      confusing how one is supposed to flow through and see everything. Things
      are numbered but it is confusing whether the numbers are for ordering or
      for linkage to the right column</li>
      <li>Beautiful <br>
      This infographic is unappealing because it is so comlicated that
      to be able to understand what it's saying would take several minutes.
      All the elements seem to jump at you to the point where the eyes just wander
      not knowing where to start.</li>
      <li>Insightful <br>
      This infographic is not insightful because most of the stuff it talks about
      are self evident. In a war we would need to restore the military; yes but that
      doesnt tell me much. It seems mostly at a superficial level.</li>
      <li> Truthful <br>
      This infographic is absent many facts and data that would make it appealing.
      Most of the steps are vague and not well defined. In the middle it just says
      "3 trillion dollars", but why 3?
      </li>
      <li>Enlightening <br>
      This infographic can't be enlightening because it is too complicated and
      confusing to follow to draw anything from it. We're left with the fact that
      some 10 factors somehow are related to the 3 trillion dollar war.
