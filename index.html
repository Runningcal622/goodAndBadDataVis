    <h2>A good Example of Data Visualization</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Functionality <br>
      This infographic is functional because it shows
      current data through the pie charts and then shows the
      trends through the line graphs to the right. It clearly demonstates the fact
      that the most people believe that the best is ahead of us.</li>
      <li>Beautiful <br>
      This infographic is generally pleasing because of the light blue and yellow they
      used to differentiate the different responses. However, it could be improved because the
      light blue is so often used. Maybe using different colors would make the globe stand out
      more from the rest of the background.</li>
      <li>Insightful <br>
      This infographic is insightful because of the way it uses past data to show the trend
      among patents. The United States has been the leader in recent past and while that remains
      true in this data; it is interesting to see Japan and China growing rapidly while the
      US declines. It is also helpful that the colors used for the lines in the graph match
      up with the colors used for the opinions. If a country is showing a negative correlation
      then it is colored with a "behind" response color.</li>
      <li> Truthful <br>
      This infographic is truthful because it does not seek to decieve the viewer of information
      important to the graphic. All graphs have only one y-axis. This info graphic is used to
      display data, not force you to an incorrect conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>Enlightening <br>
      This infographic is important because it seeks to inform on the topic of wether the
      collective optimism of progress will continue and lead to more improvements. The idea of
      self fufilling prophecy is vital becasue if people think that progress is in the past then
      it could occur soley because people think that it can't.
